# Alyra x Solana Foundation Training

> _Training Duration:_ 8 weeks  
> _Final Project:_ 2 weeks (located in a separate repository)

This repository contains course materials, specifically the exercises we completed during our training, along with a few notes.

## Course Outline

### Week 1 & 2: Introduction to Solana Ecosystem

Overview of Solana's architecture  
Understanding consensus mechanisms  
Learning about validators and Proof of History (PoH)  
Introduction to the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM)

### Week 3: Development Tools and Building a DApp (Frontend)

**_Exercise: react-jupyter-front_**  
Presentation of various development tools. We started with front-end development using React to interact with a Solana program. Additionally, we performed a swap using Jupyter, both with and without Anchor, to understand its utility.

### Week 4: Rust Programming

**_Exercise: rust-temperature-exercise_**  
During this week, we focused on Rust programming by working through exercises from [rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings). We concluded with a recap exercise to consolidate our understanding.

### Week 5 & 6: Programs, Playground, and Anchor

**_Exercise: live-intro-playground_**  
We explored the Solana Playground, where we initiated programs, performed deployments, and conducted testing. Various proposed exercises provided hands-on experience.

**_Exercise: voting-app_**  
**_Exercise (bonus): tic-tac-toe_**  
We developed a more complex voting application using Anchor and Next.js. This project allowed us to deepen our understanding of Program Derived Addresses (PDAs). And we had a tic tac toe game as a bonus.

**_Exercise: program-optimisation_**  
We then focused on program optimization and advanced concepts such as Cross-Program Invocations (CPI), oracles, security..

### Week 7: Business Aspects

We delved deeper into understanding validators and discussed tips related to working and building a business on Solana, including how to generate ideas and create projects. We also had a presentation from Superteam France.

## Note

These exercises are intended as learning materials and do not encompass the entirety of the course content. The training was structured to provide a comprehensive understanding of the Solana ecosystem and its development practices.

# Alyra x Solana Foundation Training

> _Training Duration:_ 8 weeks  
> _Final Project:_ 2 weeks (located in a separate repository)

This repository contains course materials, specifically the exercises we completed during our training and few notes.

## Course Outline

### Week 1: Introduction to Solana Ecosystem

Overview of Solana's architecture
Understanding consensus mechanisms
Learning about validators and Proof of History (PoH)

### Week 2: React and Jupyter Integration

**_Exercise: react-jupyter-front_**  
We started with the front-end development using React to interact with a program. We also performed a swap using Jupyter, both with and without Anchor, to grasp its utility.

### Week 3: Rust Programming

**_Exercise: rust-temperature-exercise_**  
During this week, we focused on Rust programming by working through exercises from [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings). We concluded with a recap exercise to consolidate our understanding.

### Week 4: Exploring Solana Playground

**_Exercise: live-intro-playground_**  
We discovered the Solana Playground, where we initiated programs, deployment, and testing. We completed various proposed exercises to get hands-on experience.

### Week 5: Building a Voting Application

**_Exercise: voting-app_**  
We developed a more complex voting application using Anchor and Next.js. This project allowed us to deepen our understanding of Program Derived Addresses (PDAs).

### Week 6: Program Optimization

**_Exercise: program-optimisation_**  
In the final week, we focused on program optimization and other advanced concepts, culminating in exercises to apply our knowledge.

## Note

These exercises are intended as learning materials and do not encompass the entirety of the course content. The training was structured to provide a comprehensive understanding of the Solana ecosystem and its development practices.
